# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Pavan!

I am an M.Sc. student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London (UCL) and a research intern at Century Tech.

I am particularly motivated by reinforcement learning and its application to large language models. My most recent project involves finetuning LLaMA-based LLM agents in text-based multi-step environments.

My core interest lies in the safe and responsible advancement of AI for the benefit of humanity. I am eager to apply my skills to challenging problems with a positive societal impact.
